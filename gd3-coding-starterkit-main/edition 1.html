            1.THE DANCING PLAGUE         </p>
          <p class="text8">
            I first became interested in this topic by listening to a podcast about a fascinating case of mass psychogenic disorder in 1518. This is usually referred to as “the dancing plague” since a large group of people started dancing without being able to stop. The next slides will give some more information about my research into the dancing plague.        </div>

            2.	FRAU TROFFEA         </p>
          <p class="text8">
            In July 1518, residents of the city of Strasbourg (then part of the Holy Roman Empire) were struck by a sudden and seemingly uncontrollable urge to dance. The hysteria kicked off when a woman known as Frau Troffea stepped into the street and began to silently twist, twirl and shake. She kept up her solo dance-a-thon for nearly a week, and before long, some three-dozen other Strasbourgeois had joined in. By August, the dancing epidemic had claimed as many as 400 victims. With no other explanation for the phenomenon, local physicians blamed it on “hot blood” and suggested the afflicted simply gyrate the fever away.          </p>

            3. A STAGE FOR FIGHTING DANCE          </p>
          <p class="text8">
            A stage was constructed and professional dancers were brought in. The town even hired a band to provide backing music, but it wasn’t long before the marathon started to take its toll. Many dancers collapsed from sheer exhaustion. Some even died from strokes and heart attacks. The strange episode didn’t end until September, when the dancers were whisked away to a mountaintop shrine to pray for absolution.          </p>

            4. LEGEND OR TRUTH?          </p>
          <p class="text8">
            The Strasbourg dancing plague might sound like the stuff of legend, but it’s well documented in 16th-century historical records. It’s also not the only known incident of its kind. Similar manias took place in Switzerland, Germany and Holland, though few were as large—or deadly—as the one triggered in 1518.          </p>

            5. WHAT COULD HAVE LED PEOPLE TO DANCE THEMSELVES TO DEATH?          </p>
          <p class="text8">
            According to historian John Waller, the explanation most likely concerns St. Vitus, a Catholic saint who pious 16th-century Europeans believed had the power to curse people with a dancing plague. When combined with the horrors of disease and famine, both of which were tearing through Strasbourg in 1518, the St. Vitus superstition may have triggered a stress-induced hysteria that took hold of much of the city.

            Other theories have suggested the dancers were members of a religious cult, or even that they accidentally ingested ergot, a toxic mold that grows on damp rye and produces spasms and hallucinations.        </div>

          <p class="text8">
            While researching this topic, I also looked into other historical examples of superstition, madness, and psychology. The mind has always been a great mystery, and scientists have continuously tried to find ways to alter it and even control it. Some had the intention of helping others get access to their subconsciousness, while others have been attempting to change their perception through brainwashing. I will quickly review some of my main findings in the following slides.        </div>

          <p class="text8">
            The Danse Macabre consists of the dead, or a personification of death, summoning representatives from all walks of life to dance along to the grave, typically with a pope, emperor, king, child, and labourer. The effect is both frivolous and terrifying, beseeching its audience to react emotionally. It was produced as memento mori, to remind people of the fragility of their lives and how vain are the glories of earthly life.          </p>

          <p class="text8">
            According to a Greek legend the gods were looking for a place to hide the greatest power that they held. They thought about placing it on the highest mountain top but they figure we would look there eventually. This discussion went on with different gods suggesting different places but none of them would be safe from humans looking. Eventually it was YPNOS that suggested that the greatest gift be hidden in each of us because we would never think to look inside ourselves for it.          </p>

            4. FRANZ ANTON MESMER          </p>
          <p class="text8">
            Franz Anton Mesmer is referred to by most as the founder of hypnotism as it is today. He studied the effects of magnetism under Father Hell, a Viennese Jesuit (1720-1792). He later believed that he possessed the ability to heal using a theory called animal magnetism.
            Mesmer treated patients both individually and in groups. With individuals he would sit in front of his patient with his knees touching the patient’s knees, pressing the patient’s thumbs in his hands, looking fixedly into the patient’s eyes. Mesmer made “passes”, moving his hands from patients’ shoulders down along their arms. He then pressed his fingers on the patient’s hypochondriac region (the area below the diaphragm), sometimes holding his hands there for hours. Many patients felt peculiar sensations or had convulsions that were regarded as crises and supposed to bring about the cure. Mesmer would often conclude his treatments by playing some music on a glass armonica.          </p>

            5.BRAINWASING AMERICAN TROOPS IN KOREA          </p>
          <p class="text8">
            For the American soldiers trapped in the Korean prison camps, brainwashing meant forced standing, deprivation of food and sleep, solitary confinement, and repeated exposure to Communist propaganda. The early 1950s marked the debut of the military’s studies into psychological torture, and instead of concluding the American soldiers needed rehabilitation, military directors came to a more ominous conclusion: that the men were simply weak. “They became less interested in the fantasy of brainwashing and became worried our men couldn’t stand up to torture,” Holmes says. This resulted in the Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape program (SERE), meant to inoculate men against future attempts at psychological torture by using those same torture techniques in their training.          </p>

            1. HYSTERIA         </p>
          <p class="text8">
            Hysteria is the Greek word for uterus and was primarily used to describe mental illness in women. The word is still in use today and points to the gendered association with mental illness and madness in general. Madness points to breaking societal norms or acting in ways that are not expected. The pressure that is being put on women in today's society is quite severe, and any reactions or anger expressed because of this are being classified as madness. Madness in women can, therefore, be used as an act of rebellion, breaking the unfair expectations being put on them entirely and choosing to be free. I found a few examples of this, primarily in film; these will be shown in the following slides.         </div>

            2. DAISIES          </p>
          <p class="text8">
            Daisies, by Vera Chytilová, is an early entry to the incredible Czechoslavakian New Wave of cinema that occurred in the late sixties and seventies. The movie is about two young women named Marie trying to make sense of everyday life in a capitalist and patriarchal society. The plot is quite significant for the era, especially considering the feminist and provocative themes. The director was even banned from making more films. In the movie, the main characters use childlike behaviours associated with women during that time as a weapon to manipulate men. They are performing innocent, incompetent, and cute behaviours to get things from the men around them. However, they are also showcasing a lot of behaviours associated with men during this era, like stuffing their faces with food, talking loudly, and taking up space. They are using gendered stereotypes to get what they want but are, at the same time, unapologetically doing what they want at any given time.            </p>

            3. A GIRL BECOMING A MONSTER AS SHE ENTERS WOMANHOOD          </p>
          <p class="text8">
            There are a lot of examples depicting the change that happens in a girl as she enters womanhood. In most movies and books, the change is usually shown in the woman herself and is generally depicted through madness and her becoming a monster. Examples of this can be found in Carrie, Jennifer’s body, ginger snabs and raw. However, in the 1970 Czechoslovak surrealist movie “Valerie and Her Week of Wonders” (Jaromil Jireš), Valerie is not the one changing, but everyone around her does. The people around her change into monsters that prey on her, and she has to explore this new world her menstruation has crafted for her. The movie's plot takes place throughout one week because that is the length of a normal menstruation, but also because of the time it took God to make the world. The movie, therefore, also has a religious parallel.          </p>

          <p class="text8">
            The idea of madness can be viewed as a form of non-productive life, often perceived as a burden to society, particularly in the context of mass psychogenic disorders. However, the popularity of raves highlights their essential role in fostering productivity. While partying is generally seen as unproductive, it can have significant benefits for mental health, making it important to nurture this aspect of our desires. Dancing, for instance, generates endorphins. Raves, with their dark settings, vibrant lights, and lasers, create an environment that enhances these positive experiences.          </p>

ROUTINE AS A FORM OF AUTOMATION          </p>
          <p class="text8">
            Routine can be viewed as a form of automation—a means of making life more efficient since it requires less thought. However, this can also involve masking certain character traits that might be perceived as undesirable. In this context, "madness" or mental illness is often seen as an unproductive aspect of society. As a result, individuals may feel pressured to perform normalcy in order to avoid being labeled as burdensome, unproductive, lazy, or crazy.          </p>

THE ALLURE OF MADNESS       </p>
          <p class="text8">
            Rising pressure from our environment can cause stress, mental illness, and burnout. Trauma stored in our bodies can be released by dance. Raving can be a way for people to be unproductive together; it provides a space for freedom without judgment and pressure to conform to societal norms. Raves usually take place in dark rooms, with fog and loud music. It is a very individual experience, that still happens amongst other people. This environment promotes a space for people to dive into madness together. Everyone is welcome (depending on the club, of course), and you can be as mad and unproductive as you want. It is a socially acceptable way to let go of all responsibilities, and it is even expected to take time to recover afterward.         </div>
