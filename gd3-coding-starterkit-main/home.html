              The first edition of this zine offers an overview of my research into mass psychogenic disorder, madness, and rave culture. I will explore my interest in this topic by addressing some general questions. Madness refers to the act of breaking social norms and behaving in unexpected ways. There are many different ways this can manifest. Throughout history, there have been numerous examples related to mass psychogenic disorder, hypnosis, gender stereotypes, and rave culture. I will share some of these examples along with my personal opinions on the subject.            </p>

              The second edition of this zine offers a dance experience that invites you to explore the allure of madness through dance, all from the comfort of your own home. The images and animations reflect the intensity of rave culture, allowing you to immerse yourself in this experience without actually going to a club. Let your mind wander into the realm of madness and immerse yourself in the intensity of this experience.

              The third edition of this zine features “The Rave Continuum: plot and Politics of Europe’s Last Youth Culture” by Peris Bekkering. Rave proposes a different logic, than that of the working day, and Peris Bekkering gives the reader a guide to that logic through the materials she has gathered. “ There is something about today’s endless chain of crises that is so numbing. It has stopped feeling like an event. There is no before and after the crisis. Crisis has become permanent, repetitive.”
